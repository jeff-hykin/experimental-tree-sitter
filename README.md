# What is this?
This repo is a central location for tracking the progress of the Tree-Sitter implementaion for VS Code. The issues are kept up to date with different developments, and can be used as a place for discussion and problem solving.

The codebase is used as an example implementation of a tree sitter, but it is not the "official-unofficial" implementation of the tree sitter.

# Whats the current status?: Pre-alpha
The only major theme supported is the stock VS Code theme, and the only supported languages are C++, C, Typescript, and Go. It will be awhile (likely months) before there is widespread theme support.
